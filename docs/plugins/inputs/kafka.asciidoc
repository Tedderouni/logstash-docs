=== kafka

* Version: 5.1.6
* Released on: January 25, 2017
* https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-input-kafka/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#516[Changelog]



==== Getting Help

For questions about the plugin, open a topic in the http://discuss.elastic.co[Discuss] forums. For bugs or feature requests, open an issue in https://github.com/elastic/logstash[Github].
For the list of Elastic supported plugins, please consult the https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#show_logstash_plugins[Elastic Support Matrix].

==== Description

This input will read events from a Kafka topic.

This plugin uses Kafka Client 0.10.0.1. For broker compatibility, see the official https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/Compatibility+Matrix[Kafka compatibility reference].

If you're using a plugin version that was released after {version}, see the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/master/plugins-inputs-kafka.html[latest plugin documentation] for updated information about Kafka compatibility. If you require features not yet available in this plugin (including client version upgrades), please file an issue with details about what you need.

This input supports connecting to Kafka over:

* SSL (requires plugin version 3.0.0 or later)
* Kerberos SASL (requires plugin version 5.1.0 or later) 

By default security is disabled but can be turned on as needed.

The Logstash Kafka consumer handles group management and uses the default offset management
strategy using Kafka topics.

Logstash instances by default form a single logical group to subscribe to Kafka topics
Each Logstash Kafka consumer can run multiple threads to increase read throughput. Alternatively, 
you could run multiple Logstash instances with the same `group_id` to spread the load across
physical machines. Messages in a topic will be distributed to all Logstash instances with
the same `group_id`.

Ideally you should have as many threads as the number of partitions for a perfect balance --
more threads than partitions means that some threads will be idle

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

Add a field to an event

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-auto_commit_interval_ms]]
===== `auto_commit_interval_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"5000"`

The frequency in milliseconds that the consumer offsets are committed to Kafka.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-auto_offset_reset]]
===== `auto_offset_reset` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

What to do when there is no initial offset in Kafka or if an offset is out of range:

* earliest: automatically reset the offset to the earliest offset
* latest: automatically reset the offset to the latest offset
* none: throw exception to the consumer if no previous offset is found for the consumer's group
* anything else: throw exception to the consumer.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-bootstrap_servers]]
===== `bootstrap_servers` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"localhost:9092"`

A list of URLs to use for establishing the initial connection to the cluster.
This list should be in the form of `host1:port1,host2:port2` These urls are just used
for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically)
so this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in
case a server is down).

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-check_crcs]]
===== `check_crcs` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Automatically check the CRC32 of the records consumed. This ensures no on-the-wire or on-disk
corruption to the messages occurred. This check adds some overhead, so it may be
disabled in cases seeking extreme performance.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-client_id]]
===== `client_id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"logstash"`

The id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this
is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing
a logical application name to be included.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-codec]]
===== `codec` 

  * Value type is <<codec,codec>>
  * Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for input data. Input codecs are a convenient method for decoding your data before it enters the input, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-connections_max_idle_ms]]
===== `connections_max_idle_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Close idle connections after the number of milliseconds specified by this config.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-consumer_threads]]
===== `consumer_threads` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

Ideally you should have as many threads as the number of partitions for a perfect
balance — more threads than partitions means that some threads will be idle

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-decorate_events]]
===== `decorate_events` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Option to add Kafka metadata like topic, message size to the event.
This will add a field named `kafka` to the logstash event containing the following attributes:
  `topic`: The topic this message is associated with
  `consumer_group`: The consumer group used to read in this event
  `partition`: The partition this message is associated with
  `offset`: The offset from the partition this message is associated with
  `key`: A ByteBuffer containing the message key

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-enable_auto_commit]]
===== `enable_auto_commit` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"true"`

If true, periodically commit to Kafka the offsets of messages already returned by the consumer. 
This committed offset will be used when the process fails as the position from
which the consumption will begin.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-enable_metric]]
===== `enable_metric` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`

Disable or enable metric logging for this specific plugin instance
by default we record all the metrics we can, but you can disable metrics collection
for a specific plugin.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-exclude_internal_topics]]
===== `exclude_internal_topics` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Whether records from internal topics (such as offsets) should be exposed to the consumer.
If set to true the only way to receive records from an internal topic is subscribing to it.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-fetch_max_wait_ms]]
===== `fetch_max_wait_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The maximum amount of time the server will block before answering the fetch request if
there isn't sufficient data to immediately satisfy `fetch_min_bytes`. This
should be less than or equal to the timeout used in `poll_timeout_ms`

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-fetch_min_bytes]]
===== `fetch_min_bytes` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The minimum amount of data the server should return for a fetch request. If insufficient
data is available the request will wait for that much data to accumulate
before answering the request.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-group_id]]
===== `group_id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"logstash"`

The identifier of the group this consumer belongs to. Consumer group is a single logical subscriber
that happens to be made up of multiple processors. Messages in a topic will be distributed to all
Logstash instances with the same `group_id`

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-heartbeat_interval_ms]]
===== `heartbeat_interval_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The expected time between heartbeats to the consumer coordinator. Heartbeats are used to ensure 
that the consumer's session stays active and to facilitate rebalancing when new
consumers join or leave the group. The value must be set lower than
`session.timeout.ms`, but typically should be set no higher than 1/3 of that value.
It can be adjusted even lower to control the expected time for normal rebalances.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-id]]
===== `id` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add a unique `ID` to the plugin configuration. If no ID is specified, Logstash will generate one. 
It is strongly recommended to set this ID in your configuration. This is particularly useful 
when you have two or more plugins of the same type, for example, if you have 2 grok filters. 
Adding a named ID in this case will help in monitoring Logstash when using the monitoring APIs.

[source,ruby]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
output {
 stdout {
   id => "my_plugin_id"
 }
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


[[plugins-inputs-kafka-jaas_path]]
===== `jaas_path` 

  * Value type is <<path,path>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) API supplies user authentication and authorization 
services for Kafka. This setting provides the path to the JAAS file. Sample JAAS file for Kafka client:
[source,java]
----------------------------------
KafkaClient {
  com.sun.security.auth.module.Krb5LoginModule required
  useTicketCache=true
  renewTicket=true
  serviceName="kafka";
  };
----------------------------------

Please note that specifying `jaas_path` and `kerberos_config` in the config file will add these  
to the global JVM system properties. This means if you have multiple Kafka inputs, all of them would be sharing the same 
`jaas_path` and `kerberos_config`. If this is not desirable, you would have to run separate instances of Logstash on 
different JVM instances.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-kerberos_config]]
===== `kerberos_config` 

  * Value type is <<path,path>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Optional path to kerberos config file. This is krb5.conf style as detailed in https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-key_deserializer_class]]
===== `key_deserializer_class` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer"`

Java Class used to deserialize the record's key

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-max_partition_fetch_bytes]]
===== `max_partition_fetch_bytes` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The maximum amount of data per-partition the server will return. The maximum total memory used for a
request will be <code>#partitions * max.partition.fetch.bytes</code>. This size must be at least
as large as the maximum message size the server allows or else it is possible for the producer to
send messages larger than the consumer can fetch. If that happens, the consumer can get stuck trying
to fetch a large message on a certain partition.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-max_poll_records]]
===== `max_poll_records` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The period of time in milliseconds after which we force a refresh of metadata even if
we haven't seen any partition leadership changes to proactively discover any new brokers or partitions

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-partition_assignment_strategy]]
===== `partition_assignment_strategy` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The class name of the partition assignment strategy that the client will use to distribute
partition ownership amongst consumer instances

===== `reconnect_backoff_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The amount of time to wait before attempting to reconnect to a given host.
This avoids repeatedly connecting to a host in a tight loop.
This backoff applies to all requests sent by the consumer to the broker.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-request_timeout_ms]]
===== `request_timeout_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The configuration controls the maximum amount of time the client will wait
for the response of a request. If the response is not received before the timeout
elapses the client will resend the request if necessary or fail the request if
retries are exhausted.

[[plugins-inputs-kafka-retry_backoff_ms]]
===== `retry_backoff_ms` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

This is the base class for Logstash inputs.
Add a `type` field to all events handled by this input.

Types are used mainly for filter activation.

The type is stored as part of the event itself, so you can
also use the type to search for it in Kibana.

If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for
example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then
a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at
the shipper stays with that event for its life even
when sent to another Logstash server.
